# Schema generation 

Maby different ideas where tried to get a nice way to generate the schema for the recipie object type.

- I tried doing it with an open api spec, and it sort of works, but I wanted auto completion for when I write the json document for each recipie and for that you need a json schema.

- So this second approach was to write a type in typescript and generate the json schema from this, much easier to work with and the result is no half bad.

This folder is mainly as a repo for these temporay files and as a history of what I tried.

[!NOTE]
Consider the `shema.json` to the defintive version.
